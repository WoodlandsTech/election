# MoCo 2020 Ballot Tracking Requirements

Some of the files in this repo are just for my playing around with web / HTML since it has been a long time since doing any of this. 

## Data files
1. Obtain files from MoCo election site: https://elections.mctx.org/EvHistoryFiles/GEN110320_12.07.2020.zip
2. Unzip
3. Clean blank lines at end of file
4. Place where web site can access them

## Web Site

### Input Forms

1. Request first and last name as appears on voter registration
2. Likely to need additional information if duplicate names in county
3. Should we capitalize first letter of names to avoid bad results?

### Results Presentation

#### Found results
1. Show results on new web page?
1. Show the found name.
1. Show date of each status update
2. Show the status of ballots as explained in [Notice of Voting Order Priority for Web](https://github.com/rmerriam/election/blob/main/references/Notice%20of%20Voting%20Order%20Priority%20for%20Web.pdf)
2. Show voting entities, i.e. election name column, e.g. CISD, Township, County? 
    
#### Failed retrevial
1. Message that results not found
2. Advise checking spelling on registration card.
3. Provide link to MoCo Election site for checking registration
4. Allow entry / edit of names on this page? Or automatically jump back to index if results are bad adding error? 
   

### Footer

1. Show promotional line like "Web site provided by Woodlands Area Software Enthusiats"
2. Disclaimer: "Not responsible for accuracy of data. Use with caution."
3. Copyright?
4. Link to meetup or link to a website that is more than a "join slack" page which doesn't work.
